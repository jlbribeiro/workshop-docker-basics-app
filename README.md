# "Docker basics" workshop app

**This app was used as the basis for a workshop I gave.**
**You can check the workshop details [here](https://jlbribeiro.com/talks/2016/04/08/docker-basics/).**

This repo uses the `git` history to incrementally add complexity to a basic
Python application and its `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` in order to
show common basic Docker pitfalls and how they can be tackled.

It aims to gradually introduce the basics of Docker and explain its internals.


## TODO

Rebase the whole repo and add a `README.md` to each step, in order to explain
what is happening (and why the step is designed to fail somehow.
